Plan

What needs to happen:

Use wireframe to implement the HTML.

Animations required:
8-bit characters to use from Stranger Things - character select seems like it'll be too difficult - try once game functionality is established.

put the animation/gifs into required cells. Need each to move right, left and down. It'll bounce off the sides when it can't go past the edge - use setInterval for how quickly this happens. Maybe each time it hits the side, it can speed up increasing the difficulty as it goes.

Create the elements


Execution
Functions 

- grid-movement and prevent cells from being able to go off the edges.
- movement - use key codes.
- player position - needs to have a 'start position' and also be limited to side-side movement which means will need to specify grid movement this will need setInterval().
- enemy startposition 
  - need to keep the 'class' to go side to side, if one hits the side then the whole class can go down by one 'cell' and repeat the movement - how to keep it going if the rows on the side are gone? clear interval and set new interval? Maybe make it so that if ANY of the class hits the edge, then they all have to start moving in the opposite direction.
- function to make invaders bounce off the edges
- user-name input - function for queryselection the name input and display it within the box using innerText.
- hit detection - maybe use the something like if bulletClass [ ]  === invader [ ] === splice the invader? - similarly for the player. Can use rect to specifiy pathway? If classBullet === classHero - 1 life && create animation (search up requestAnimationFrame(callback)).  Can create an array to give value to the invaders and then hit detection can specifically remove a certain index of it?
  - maybe make a different animation or sound every time the enemy's shot hits the bottom. (instead of using a gun, the demogorgans can send out small demogorgans.
- need to create random 'shots' from the invaders and to ensure it's always the bottom row using the 'keydown'
- unlocking the start game with an insert coin function e.g. if button pressed in cell [ ] then startGame.disabled = false.
- resetgame function - needs to clear interval and add everything to the same position as 'insertCoin' - maybe make one coin = 3 tries so similarly to 3 lives, can only 'restart' 3 times or else will have to enter a new coin -disable the restart and start button at this point again.
- endgame function for when player dies or if enemyclass reaches the same row as the hero - possibly clear interval at game over to stop movement continuing.
- buttonclicked and need to save to local storage
- new function that if all demogorgan's class = 0, possibly use an animation to 'pop up' in the cells - maybe use alert - and then introduce vecna to start making his way down multiple cells so it takes more than one hit to defeat him - possibly add 'running up that hill' audio before he comes out so time-delay him by however long the music lasts.
- Add the gif of the mind flayer when this happens.
  - Once he has been defeated, can add difficulty to the game by essentially 'resetting' the invaders but this time increasing the speed
- Try to save highest scores according to the username input so possibly a [key, value] function here.
  - Translate this to the container on the side of the game.
- need to make an 
- function for the different sounds (shooting, hitting, missing, start game, end game, insert coin, username input).  - ensure that the default volume settings are reduced for the browser in loadup.
